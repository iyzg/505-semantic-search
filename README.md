# 505 Semantic Search

Very much based off [Lilian Weng's Emoji Semantic Search](https://github.com/lilianweng/emoji-semantic-search/tree/main). You just need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and it should run locally! As for the messages, you can use [this](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) to export messages from Discord.

I mostly just wanted experience with JS and Python, and for any good source code, you should maybe go see other codebasees :p
